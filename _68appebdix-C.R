# updating R
# The easiest way to stay current with R is to periodically check the CRAN website. 
# The website is updated for each new release and makes the release available for download. 
# Youâ€™ll have to install the new release. The process is the same as when you first installed R.


# updating R packages
update.packages("tidyverse")
update.packages(c("ggplot2", "reshape2", "dplyr"))
