# read.table() function
# use sep to tell read.table what character your file uses to separate data entries.
# use header to tell read.table 
# whether the first line of the file contains variable names instead of values.
# If you know that your data uses a certain symbol to represent missing entries, 
# you can tell read.table (and the preceding functions) 
# what the symbol is with the na.strings argument.
# read.table will convert all instances of the missing information symbol to NA, 
# which is Râ€™s missing information symbol
